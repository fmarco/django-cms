3.2 release notes
#################

In this release we have tried to maintain maximum backwards-compatibility, particularly for
third-party applications, and endeavoured to identify and tidy loose ends in the system wherever
possible.

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    3.2 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version. Please read :ref:`upgrade-guide-3.2` for a step-by-step guide to the
    process of upgrading from 3.1 to 3.2.

*****************
What's new in 3.2
*****************

Renaming cms_app, cms_toolbar, menu modules
===========================================

``cms_app.py``, ``cms_toolbar.py`` and ``menu.py`` naming convention has been changed to
``cms_apps.py``, ``cms_toolbars.py`` and ``cms_menus.py`` for consistency.

Old names are still supported but deprecated; support will be removed in 3.4.

Action required
---------------

Rename ``cms_app.py`` to ``cms_apps.py``, ``cms_toolbar.py`` to ``cms_toolbar.py``
and ``menu.py`` to ``menus.py``.

*****************************
Backward incompatible changes
*****************************

* ``cms_app.py``, ``cms_toolbar.py`` and ``menu.py`` shipped in django CMS have been renamed
  to the new naming convention. In case you import those modules, you have to change the code
  accordingly.
